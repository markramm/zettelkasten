## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in cascade-research, please report it responsibly.

**Do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email the maintainers directly or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/transparency-cascade/cascade-research/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix within 7 days for critical issues.

## Scope

This policy applies to the `cascade-research` Python package and its server components (REST API, MCP server).

## Best Practices for Users

- Never commit your `.env` file or API keys to version control
- Use read-only KB configurations for untrusted data sources
- Run the REST API behind a reverse proxy in production
- Keep dependencies up to date
